To whom it may concern,

Thank you for taking into account my appeal. I am appealing on the basis that the penalty charge notice is invalid as a result of the court house being closed on the promised date to appear.

To be more specific, I am writing in regards to Citation # DM90812 (Docket # 0001199484). I signed a "promise to appear" on January 13, 2017, which was graciously postponed until February 13, 2017, due to my holiday travel plans, and in both cases I was expected to appear at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse. However, I arrived on the date I promised to appear - February 13, 2017 - to find the court house closed for Abraham Lincoln's birthday. I never received notice of this closure.

Enclosed in this letter you will find proof of my above claims, namely:

a.) Proof of the postponement of my "promise to appear" date.
b.) Proof of my appearance at the courthouse on that date, but that it was closed.

Though the ticket is the result of allegedly Expired Registration, I argue that the ticket failed to adequately conform to the regulations. As the date that I was asked to appear in court was invalid, it is unenforceable.

I believe that the court should exercise fairness in cancelling a ticket that, according to the guidance, is perfectly justified to be cancelled. I will of course endeavor to avoid this again, but I feel that the issue of a ticket is an unlawful action inconsistent with precedent.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you,

Mr. Spencer Scorcelletti
