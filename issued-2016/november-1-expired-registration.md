To whom it may concern,

Thank you for taking into account my appeal. I am appealing on the basis that the penalty charge notice is invalid as a result of missing details. 

Though the ticket is the result of allegedly Expired Registration, I argue that the ticket failed to adequately conform to the regulations. As it lacked the details on how to pay the charge, it is unenforceable.

As the ticket issued is invalid, I am not liable for any charge under Chapter 4 of Title 34 of the Rules of the City of New York.

I believe that the court should exercise fairness in cancelling a ticket that, according to the guidance, is perfectly justified to be cancelled. I will of course endeavour to avoid this again, but I feel that the issue of a ticket is an unwlawful action inconsistent with precedent.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you,

Mr. Spencer Scorcelletti
